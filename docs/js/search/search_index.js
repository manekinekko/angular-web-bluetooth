@manekinekko/angular-web-bluetooth @types/web-bluetooth\nor NPM it\nnpm i -S @manekinekko/angular-web-bluetooth @types/web-bluetooth\n_Note: Make also sure the @types/web-bluetooth is installed correctly in your node_modules. _\nUse it\n1) import the WebBluetoothModule module\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { WebBluetoothModule } from '@manekinekko/angular-web-bluetooth';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    //...,\n    WebBluetoothModule.forRoot({\n      enableTracing: true // or false, this will enable logs in the browser's console\n    })\n  ]\n  //...\n})\nexport class AppModule {}2.a) use it in your service/component (the easiest way)\nHere is an annotated example using the BluetoothCore service:\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BluetoothCore } from '@manekinekko/angular-web-bluetooth';\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class BatteryLevelService {\n\n  constructor(public readonly ble: BluetoothCore) {}\n\n  getDevice() {\n    // call this method to get the connected device\n    return this.ble.getDevice$();\n  }\n\n  stream() {\n    // call this method to get a stream of values emitted by the device for a given characteristic\n    return this.ble.streamValues$().pipe(\n      map((value: DataView) => value.getInt8(0))\n    );\n  }\n\n  disconnectDevice() {\n    // call this method to disconnect from the device. This method will also stop clear all subscribed notifications\n    this.ble.disconnectDevice();\n  }\n\n  value() {\n    console.log('Getting Battery level...');\n\n    return this.ble\n      .value$({\n        service: 'battery_service',\n        characteristic: 'battery_level'\n      });\n  }\n\n}2.b) use it in your service/component (the advanced way)\nHere is an annotated example using the BluetoothCore service:\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { map, mergeMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport { BluetoothCore } from '@manekinekko/angular-web-bluetooth';\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class BatteryLevelService {\n  static GATT_CHARACTERISTIC_BATTERY_LEVEL = 'battery_level';\n  static GATT_PRIMARY_SERVICE = 'battery_service';\n\n  constructor(public ble: BluetoothCore) {}\n\n  getDevice() {\n    // call this method to get the connected device\n    return this.ble.getDevice$();\n  }\n\n  stream() {\n    // call this method to get a stream of values emitted by the device\n    return this.ble.streamValues$().pipe(map((value: DataView) => value.getUint8(0)));\n  }\n\n  disconnectDevice() {\n    this.ble.disconnectDevice();\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Get Battery Level GATT Characteristic value.\n   * This logic is specific to this service, this is why we can't abstract it elsewhere.\n   * The developer is free to provide any service, and characteristics they want.\n   *\n   * @return Emites the value of the requested service read from the device\n   */\n  value() {\n    console.log('Getting Battery level...');\n\n    return this.ble\n\n        // 1) call the discover method will trigger the discovery process (by the browser)\n        .discover$({\n          acceptAllDevices: true,\n          optionalServices: [BatteryLevelService.GATT_PRIMARY_SERVICE]\n        })\n        .pipe(\n\n          // 2) get that service\n          mergeMap((gatt: BluetoothRemoteGATTServer) => {\n            return this.ble.getPrimaryService$(gatt, BatteryLevelService.GATT_PRIMARY_SERVICE);\n          }),\n\n          // 3) get a specific characteristic on that service\n          mergeMap((primaryService: BluetoothRemoteGATTService) => {\n            return this.ble.getCharacteristic$(primaryService, BatteryLevelService.GATT_CHARACTERISTIC_BATTERY_LEVEL);\n          }),\n\n          // 4) ask for the value of that characteristic (will return a DataView)\n          mergeMap((characteristic: BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic) => {\n            return this.ble.readValue$(characteristic);\n          }),\n\n          // 5) on that DataView, get the right value\n          map((value: DataView) => value.getUint8(0))\n        )\n  }\n}API documentation\nHere &#x1F449;  https://manekinekko.github.io/angular-web-bluetooth/\nNeed a starter?\n\n\nThis project serves also as a starter.
